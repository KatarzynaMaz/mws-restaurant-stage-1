# Restaurant Review Project/Project 5 for FEND students
---

## Description

For the **Restaurant Reviews** project, the students were given a starter code for a static restaurant review app and were supposed to convert it to a mobile friendly application that will be accessible for different screen screen sizes that will also work online and offline. Service Worker was added to the application to provide offline access.

## Specification

 The code provided by Udacity had a lot of issues. It was barely usable on a desktop browser, much less a mobile device. It also doesn’t include any standard accessibility features, and it doesn’t work offline at all.

## Installation

1. Clone or download the project from the [respository](https://github.com/KatarzynaMaz/mws-restaurant-stage-1) to your     local machine and open it with your favorite text editor.
2. Run server via terminal with "$ python -m http.server" command (if you need to install Python, go to Python's [website]
   (https://www.python.org))
3. Navigate to local host in your browser `http://localhost:8000` to test the project.

## Dependencies

This repository uses [leafletjs](https://leafletjs.com/) with and API key [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/).
