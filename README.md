# Restaurant Review Project/Project 5 for FEND students
---

## Description

For the **Restaurant Reviews** project, the students were given a starter code for a static restaurant review app and were supposed to convert it to a mobile friendly application that will be accessible for different screen screen sizes that will also work online and offline. Service Worker was added to the application to provide offline access.

## Specification

 The code provided by Udacity had a lot of issues. It was barely usable on a desktop browser, much less a mobile device. It also doesn’t include any standard accessibility features, and it doesn’t work offline at all.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository from   
2. Run server via terminal with "$ python -m http.server" command (if you need to install Python, go to Python's [website]
    (https://www.python.org)) to download and install the software. 
3. Navigate to local host in your browser `http://localhost:8000`

### Note about ES6
